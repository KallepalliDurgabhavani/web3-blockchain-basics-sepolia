# Interacting with a Decentralized Application (DApp)

A DApp is a decentralized application running on a blockchain.

## Example DApp: Uniswap
Uniswap allows users to swap tokens directly without intermediaries.

## Steps to Interact
1. Open https://app.uniswap.org
2. Select Sepolia Testnet
3. Click "Connect Wallet"
4. Choose MetaMask
5. Approve the connection
6. Swap ETH to a test token (e.g., WETH)

## Observations
- Each transaction requires gas
- MetaMask asks for confirmation
- Transactions are recorded on the blockchain

## Conclusion
DApps provide transparency and user control through smart contracts.
